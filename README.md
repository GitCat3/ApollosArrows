# Apollos Arrows
This is a mod for Minecraft Forge 1.19.3 that adds custom arrows to minecraft! The currently implemented arrows are:
1. Airstrike Arrow
    - Rains down a mix of explosive and incendiary arrows from the sky, bringing infinite destruction to your foes
2. Ender Arrow
    - Teleports the shooter to wherever it lands, basically just an ender pearl, but *cooler*
3. Explosive Arrow
    - Does exactly what it sounds like
4. incendiary Arrow
    - Makes a lot of fire
5. Magnetic Arrow
    - Pulls nearby entities towards wherever it lands, is currently a bit buggy though
6. Mitosis Arrow
    - An arrow, that shoots more arrows! Not very useful currently, will probably buff in the future
7. Transmutation Arrow
    - Takes items from your offhand and converts up to 64 blocks around where it hits to the block you are holding
